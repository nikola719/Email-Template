The purpose of this trial task is to test your HTML, JavaScript and CSS skills.
A few quick notes:
The solution needs to be fully functional by copying and pasting the entire code here:
https://htmledit.squarefree.com/

We are checking for 3 things:
Quality of code.
Style / graphics (CSS).
Functionality (JavaScript).

Although we are not testing this, it’s assumed that you have at-least a basic level of experience with WordPress, as this is where most of the work will be done.

Entire task should take you 20 – 40 minutes.
The Trial Task:
Create 3 spaces / areas that each has a different function:
Left Part:
Width is 50% of the screen.
Background is a picture of a phone.
There are 2 inputs inside the phone screen –
Subject line (input)
Email body (textarea)
The goal is to simulate how an email would look in someone’s phone (for example, in the Gmail app).
Below is a button called “add email template”.
When the button is clicked, the subject line + email template is saved in a list on the middle side.

Middle Part:
Width is 25% of the screen.
Shows a list of all the saved subject lines + email body combinations.
Next to each set of subject line + email body is an X button.
Pressing on the X asks you if you’re sure you want to remove the email template.
Clicking on a set of subject line + email body will show their content on the Left Part.

Right Part:
Width is 25% of the screen.
On the right side will be 3 buttons with the following text:
{company}
{phone}
{URL}
If you click on a button, it will add the text of that button to either the subject line or the email body on the Left Part. (depending which one is currently focused on / selected)
